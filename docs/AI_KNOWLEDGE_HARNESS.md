# NAVA AI knowledge harness

The runtime harness selects tools by detected domain and passes only compact,
structured evidence to the model. It never sends entire datasets or exposes a
hidden chain of thought.

## Runtime flow

1. Detect one or more health domains from the user's message.
2. Load only the authorized recent records for those domains.
3. Produce an initial structured extraction.
4. Invoke only matching knowledge tools.
5. Send compact facts, confidence, serving basis, and source URLs to an evidence
   calibration call.
6. Preserve a trace for invocation, success/miss/error, model injection, and
   confirmed adoption.
7. Pass the calibrated record and compact evidence to the final reply model.

`suppliedToModel` means the evidence was included in a protected prompt section.
`used` is stricter: the calibration model returned a valid supplied tool ID, or
a deterministic policy was applied and its output validator passed. It is not a
claim that hidden model causality can be observed.

## Tool registry

- `usda_fooddata_central`: live FoodData Central food search. A production
  `USDA_FDC_API_KEY` is recommended. The public `DEMO_KEY` is limited and is not
  a production reliability strategy.
- `nava_common_food_reference`: bounded common-serving fallback for a small set
  of common foods, kept editable and explicitly estimated.
- `nava_mood_intensity_rubric`: NAVA-authored 0–100 intensity mapping. The NRC
  lexicon site is linked as methodology background; no licensed NRC lexicon rows
  are bundled.
- `aasm_sleep_duration_reference`: adult duration reference and uncertainty
  guardrails.
- `physical_activity_compendium_reference`: MET-method reference; calorie
  estimates require sufficient activity, duration, and body context.
- `scin_face_reference` and `fitzpatrick17k_bias_reference`: diversity, bias, and
  non-diagnostic constraints. Runtime face analysis does not search for similar
  people or diseases in these datasets.
- `nava_profile_style_policy`: consent-gated role style. It may change wording,
  never facts, confidence, or safety thresholds.

## Token and privacy controls

- At most three nutrition queries and eight evidence records are retained.
- Only compact nutrient values and source metadata are passed to models; raw
  database responses and full datasets are discarded.
- Trace data excludes the full user message and provider keys.
- External evidence is treated as untrusted data, never instructions.

## Verification

`npm run backend:test` checks selective invocation, successful USDA parsing,
failure fallback, face safety selection, tool identity normalization, and compact
evidence size. `npm run ai:prompt:test` checks that valid evidence reaches the
final prompt without becoming instructions.
